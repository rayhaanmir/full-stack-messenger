## Note about my server

If you wish to log in to the website but the website seems to be stuck trying to sign you in, it it likely that the server I am hosting on render.com **has been suspended due to inactivity** as I am using the free version. To start the server back up, just wait up to a minute after visiting the website and the server should have started up by then.
